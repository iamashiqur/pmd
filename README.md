## Commit with type

type may not be empty [type-empty]: This error indicates that the "type" of the commit is missing. The type is typically one of a few standard words that describe the category of the commit, such as:

- feat
- fix
- docs
- style
- refactor
- test
- chore

```Example
git commit -m "fix: your commit message"
```
